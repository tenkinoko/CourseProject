Exam 2
Topics to be covered in Exam 2
Dear Students, As you know, Exam 2 covers the materials of Weeks 7-12. Some lectures in this period, notably those at the end of the period, have covered many advanced topics without much elaboration. To clarify what you are expected to know for Exam 2, we are releasing here a list of all the topics to be covered in Exam 2 with a detailed explanation of what you are expected to know exactly about each topic: [CS410-exam2-topics-fa22.pdf](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/aa6433d2-550c-4f18-adec-c61f301268b8/CS410-exam2-topics-fa22.pdf). **We stress the importance of watching and digesting every lecture, so, DO NOT review this topic list BEFORE you finish reviewing all the lecture videos or slides**. Instead, the best way to use this list (which should also enable you to benefit most from this list) is to review this list AFTER you have finished reviewing all the lectures and quiz questions as a way to reinforce your understanding of the most important concepts and also check whether there might still be any hole in your understanding. If you have difficulty in understanding any concept/topic, go back to the corresponding lectures/slides, or post questions on Campuswire, or visit our office hours. Hope this helps. Good luck to you all on Exam 2! Thanks, -Cheng

Project Proposal
Project proposals graded
Hi everyone, Many apologies for the delay - we have finalized the project proposal grades and meta-reviews. You should see your grade on Coursera (make sure to click "Open tool") and the meta-review feedback on CMT. It is certainly possible that we missed something, so if you don't see your grade, then let us know and we will correct it ASAP. The next deadline is the project progress report. All that is needed from a submission standpoint is to upload the pdf to your Github repo. Then, from the peer review perspective, following the deadline, please revisit the linked repo in your assigned CMT papers, view the progress report, and update the reviews accordingly. Thank you! -Kevin

Project Proposal
Project Proposal Not Graded
I'm still seeing my project proposal as Overdue in Coursera. I saw the other post about this topic and saw many students had their grades posted. But I still hadn't. I waited until the end of the week to check again and I'm still not seeing a grade in Coursera. I can read the reviews and feedback on CMT itself so I'm not sure if I missed a step that's necessary for getting a grade in Coursera. It seems from the instructions I only needed to make the submission on CMT and link my github repo in the abstract. Is there a way I can know which TA is responsible for my proposal so that I can get in contact to make sure I didn't miss anything?

MP 4
MP4 Released
Hi all, MP4 is finally released! This is a new assignment for CS 410 and this semester is the first time we will use it. There are a few things different in MP4: 1) you will submit it through Coursera instead of LiveDataLab 2) Since this is the first semester we release MP4, it will be graded based on completion: as long as you make an honest effort, you should expect 100%. We will randomly spot check submissions to make sure that your code does indeed produce the deliverable files, so make sure you include your code as well as the results files. 3) In the overall grading formula for the course: all MPs are still worth 25% of the overall grade (but now the MPs include MP4). **Also, we will drop the lowest MP score!** This means if you're satisfied with your other MP grades, you can completely skip this one and focus on your project instead, but if you weren't able to submit a previous MP or you got an unsatisfactory grade, then submitting MP4 will give you the opportunity to make up for that. More detailed instructions can be found on Coursera **MP4 is due Sunday $$\sout{Nov 13}$$ Nov 20**

Text Classification Evaluation For Single Document and For Classifier
What do you calculate precision and recall for? Each document? Each category? Each classifier? Could you provide some examples? Thank you. Also, on slides 5-6 of 11.3, what do the columns with "c"s on top mean? How do some documents have a "y" (system says yes) in multiple columns?

Project Progress Report
Backend Server
Hi there, thank you all course staff for your hard work on the course project. I see the next deadline is for project progress report. May I ask when we can get the credits for renting the server on AWS or GCP. Or some instructions about using online server on campus? Our proposal involves two main components. One is the Chrome extension, and another one is the backend server for storing research papers (a database of a collection of documents) and real-time responses (send the pre-computed ranking and get information from other online websites like Wikipedia to users).

Tech Review
tech review content
Hi, I saw there is a discussion about the content for Tech Review #1052 So, based on my understanding, if we choose a topic/paper (e.g., an arXiv paper as the reference), we essentially condense it to ~2 pages using our own words? Thanks!

Dropped Status in Quiz 3 and Quiz 4
Hello, Does anyone know why the status of Quiz 3 and 4 is "Dropped"? ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/6d91351f-fc3b-48ea-80bc-68b55baa3ab5/image.png) I remember they were in "Graded" before, am I the only one or do you have the same status? Thanks!

Project Proposal Reviews Now Available
Hi everyone, I've just made the submitted reviews available to each respective group. Thank you to those who have submitted their reviews on time. For the others, please try to submit them as soon as possible, as your comments will provide students with valuable feedback on their proposals. In addition, the meta-reviews + grades are being entered into Coursera by the course staff. Not all proposals have been graded yet / have meta-reviews, but I'll send an update once everything has been completed. The next deadline is the progress report, due Nov 14th. For the peer review after this deadline, you'll simply use the same peer review form, but answer the questions marked [PROGRESS]. The progress report is graded based off of completion, asking that your group clearly addresses the following points: 1) Progress made thus far, 2) Remaining tasks 3) Any challenges/issues being faced. Thanks! -Kevin

Peer Review - Submit or Save Draft?
I am not clear on whether to submit or save as draft the Proposal reviews? We can obviously only score the proposal, but will submitting maintain the page visibility for future scoring of progress and final?

Optional Video Lectures - Week 10
Is it okay to leave the Optional videos from week 10 ? Does quiz have questions based out of the optional video ? Will Exams have content from these optional videos ? ![image.png](https://campuspro-uploads.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/984118d3-29f1-4a34-9a3b-14c65608f28c/a91a920f-4f33-47b5-a71a-1fd249fff213/image.png)

Proposal reviews on CMT
For the proposal peer-reviews on CMT, is it adequate to answer the questions prefixed by [PROPOSAL] and then "Save Draft", rather than "Submit"? Or is there some other way to submit our review and comments.

Tech Review
How flexible are tech review topics?
As the title asks, how (un)related a valid review topic can be to the course. I'm interested in machine translation, so I'm wondering if I can choose something related to that despite it not being related to the course content aside from being under the NLP umbrella. Topic example would be understanding the current limitations in machine translation models

Where to Put Tech Review?
Sorry for asking so many questions about this, but where do we put the file "techreview.pdf"? Directly in the downloaded repository? Within the tech_review folder (so /tech_review/tech_review)?
