## Overview

Our project falls under the intelligent browsing theme listed in the project guide. We aim to build a chrome extension that enables students to link Q&A on Campuswire discussion forum to coursera lecture video contents. More specifically, by using the extension, students will be able to select any keyword on Coursera web pages (lecture video transcript, homework description, etc) and easily retrieve a collection of related discussions from Campuswire. The tool will integrate learning materials from both websites in a more organized way and improve the efficiency of learning, as students no longer need to log into Campuswire and switch back and forth to manually search for Q&A regarding a topic on Coursera. They can simply highlight keywords, and bookmark / annotate those that are useful from a list of related discussion topics being fetched. 

The topic is also related to the course because for the development of the tool we will be leveraging the use of text retrieval and document ranking techniques, as well as tuning the model to achieve optimal accuracy. We will also scrape and index the web pages through an implementation of an inverted index.
